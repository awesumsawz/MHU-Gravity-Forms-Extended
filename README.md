# MHU Gravity Forms Extended
Last Updated 11/20/2024

## Description
This plugin adds a meet-the-community.php template which, in conjunction with an MHU Gravity Form, allows users to add themselves to a database of community members, enabling them to connect with like-minded hobbyists in the model horse community. To prevent malicious use, the plugin includes a database management tool that allows administrators to approve or deny entries into the community database. Additionally, the plugin provides tools to manage the database, including the removal of members upon request.

## Prerequisites
Gravity Forms (& MHU Custom Form)

## Local Setup
```bash
npm install
gulp watch
```
